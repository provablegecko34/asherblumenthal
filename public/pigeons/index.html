					How to Mourn Something You Never Saw<br>
				</h3>
				<h4 class="mb-4">
					May, 2025
				</h4>
				<p class="tc-57">
					I’ve been thinking a lot about grief lately, but not in the physical sense—more in the abstract. How you can miss something you’ve never known or experienced; how that feeling can eat away at you; and how little in this life is truly forever.<br>It’s the grief of missing something you never had. And isn’t that strange? To miss the intangible. To grieve the absence of something that never really was yours to begin with. How do you grieve something you’ve never touched, never experienced?<br>It’s like missing an entire world you never even knew existed—a world that vanished before you were born, but still somehow feels like it’s yours to mourn. When I lie in bed at 3 a.m., unable to sleep, I don’t think about everything I have. I think about everything I’ve lost, and how briefly I held onto it.<br>That’s when I think about the passenger pigeon. It’s strange. I’ll never see one. Never even have the chance to. These birds were once so common, they filled the sky in numbers so huge they blocked out the sun. They traveled in flocks that would darken entire forests.<br>
				</p><img src="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="../img/passanger%20pigeon.webp" class="img-fluid img-protected mx-auto d-block img-style lazyload" alt="passanger%20pigeon" width="730" height="730">
				<p class="tc-57">
					<br>passanger%20pigeon <span><br></span><br>And now? Now they’re gone. It wasn’t gradual. It didn’t take decades or centuries. It happened so quickly. The last one, Martha, died in 1914. Her death marked the end of something that once seemed unstoppable. I don’t know why it hits me so hard. Maybe it’s the very idea of something so huge, so overwhelming, just... vanishing.<br>How can you mourn something that wasn’t even yours to mourn? I never saw a passenger pigeon. But somehow, it’s there. In my thoughts. In the pit of my stomach. Maybe it’s the idea of how quickly things can disappear. The pigeon was a reminder of how easy it is to take things for granted. When something is everywhere, you don’t see it. You think it’s invincible. And then it’s gone, and you’re left standing there, trying to figure out how you missed it.<br>Aldo Leopold captures this beautifully when he writes, “We have erected a monument to commemorate the funeral of a species.” And that’s where this grief begins—with the realization that something has been lost in a way that’s so complete, so final, that the best we can do is build a monument to it.<br>Leopold talks about how the passenger pigeon was once everywhere—so many of them that flocks could darken the sky. I can’t even imagine that. It’s hard to picture something so abundant, so in your face, only for it to disappear without warning. Leopold writes, “The pigeon was a biological storm.” And that’s exactly what it was—a force of nature, so overwhelming that it seemed like it could never end. Until it did.<br>It’s strange, isn’t it? How something can be so present, and yet we never take the time to really see it. To appreciate it. I think about this when I reflect on the things I have now—how many of them I might take for granted. How many things, like the pigeon, will be gone before I even realize what I’ve lost.<br>I’ll never see a passenger pigeon. No one will. But somehow, I’m still grieving it. Maybe that’s part of the human condition—to mourn what’s been lost, even when we didn’t know how important it was until it was already gone.<br>Leopold says, “The wonder is not that the pigeon went out, but that he ever survived through all the millennia of pre-Babbittian time.” And maybe that’s the point. The wonder isn’t in the loss, but in the fact that the pigeon was once there at all. That something so huge, so powerful, could have been part of the world for so long, only to disappear in the blink of an eye.<br>Grief is complicated. It doesn’t always make sense. Sometimes it’s for things we’ll never have, and sometimes it’s for things we never even knew we needed. Maybe that’s what makes it so real—the things we take for granted until they’re gone, and the painful realization that we have no way to get them back.<br>I’ll never see a passenger pigeon, but maybe that’s what makes me feel it so deeply. Because I’m mourning the world that could’ve been, the world that was there before we even realized how precious it was.&nbsp;<br>
